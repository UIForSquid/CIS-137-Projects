	<h1>
	I have died.
	<br><br>
	Not in a blaze of glory, not saving a child from a fire, <br>
	or wrestling a bear on a mountaintop.<br>
	I slipped on a patch of ice in the grocery store parking lot.<br>
	One second I was holding a rotisserie chicken,<br>
	and the next I was on my back,<br>
	staring up at a gray winter sky with my breath fogging in the cold.<br>
	I remember thinking, this is ridiculous. 
	<br><br>
	Not like this. </h1>
